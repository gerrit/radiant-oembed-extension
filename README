As some OEmbed-Providers are quite slow, the results of this are cached. By
default, the cache timeout is 1 hour longer than +SiteController.cache_timeout+
(the radiant page cache timeout, 5.minutes by default). Change this time by
setting +OembedExtension.cache_timeout+ to a duration of your choosing.
